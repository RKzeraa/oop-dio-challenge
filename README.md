<h2> ðŸ“š Understand a little about: Object Oriented Programming Paradigm (OOP) </h2>

<p>
The Object Oriented (OO) view is that of a world of interacting objects.<br>
This paradigm is an analysis, design and programming model based on the approximation between the real world and the virtual world, through the creation and interaction between classes, attributes, methods, objects, among others.<br>
There are 4 main pillars of OOP: ABSTRACTION, ENCAPSULATION, INHERITANCE AND POLYMORPHISM.
